        <h2>Below is a little of his life's history.</h2>
        <p>Martin Luther King Jr. was born Michael King Jr. in January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia. He was the second of three children to Michael King and Alberta King. In August 1934, King Sr. changed his own name to Martin Luther King, and his 5 year old son's name to Martin Luther King Jr. In 1951, King graduated with a Bachelor of Divinity (B.Div.) degree from the Crozer Theological Seminary. On June 5, 1955 King received his Ph.D. degree from Boston University, with a dissertation titled A Comparison of the Conceptions of God in the Thinking of Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Wieman.King was married to a woman called Coretta Scott, the marriage took place on June 18, 1953.</p>
        <p>The Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, where King was called to be a minister in 1954, was influential in the Montgomery, Alabama, African-American community. As the church's pastor, he became known for his oratorical preaching in Montgomery and the surrounding region.</p>
        <p>In March 1955, Claudette Colvin—a fifteen-year-old black schoolgirl in Montgomery—refused to give up her bus seat to a white man in violation of Jim Crow laws, local laws in the Southern United States that enforced racial segregation. King was on the committee from the Birmingham African-American community that looked into the case; E. D. Nixon and Clifford Durr decided to wait for a better case to pursue because the incident involved a minor.</p>
        <p>Nine months later on December 1, 1955, a similar incident occurred when Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a city bus. The two incidents led to the Montgomery bus boycott, which was urged and planned by Nixon and led by King. King was in his twenties, and had just taken up his clerical role. The other ministers asked him to take a leadership role simply because his relative newness to community leadership made it easier for him to speak out. King was hesitant about taking the role but decided to do so if no one else wanted it.</p>
        <p>The boycott lasted for 385 days, and the situation became so tense that King's house was bombed. King was arrested and jailed during this campaign, which overnight drew the attention of national media, and greatly increased King's public stature. The controversy ended when the United States District Court issued a ruling in Browder v. Gayle that prohibited racial segregation on all Montgomery public buses. Blacks resumed riding the buses again, and were able to sit in the front with full legal authorization.</p>
        <p>King's role in the bus boycott transformed him into a national figure and the best-known spokesman of the civil rights movement.</p>
